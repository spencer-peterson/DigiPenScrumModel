# DigiPenScrumModel
This repository is for research, work, and results from my project on developing a scrum model that works with the workload of DigiPen students

The reaserch folder holds all the notes that I used during the project to generate my Intoduction to Scrum for DigiPen Teams. My research mainly consisted of
  - Notes taken from Management 451 at DigiPen
  - Q&A Sessions with Professor Christien Overton about how Scrum can be adjusted for Game classes
  - Speaking with other teams about:
    - How they implemented Scrum
    - Aspects that they did and did not like
    - Ways in which they overcame these issues
    - Specific things that their team did differently that should be noted
  - Speaking with professor about the structure of Game 300
  - Notes from the LeanDog Agile Discussion v3.2

The notes from LeanDog Agile Discussion was something I felt was greatly needed for this book. The book is free for everyone in PDF form and is one of the greatest tools for learning agile and applying ideas to better a team preformance. My notes took all important information, and condensed it into less pages, and provided a reference table for navigation. This helps teams and producers find teh information they need, and have the abilty to jump around, create their own bookmakrs and add on their own personal notes. My copy is meant to be a living document that will grow past just a stipped down version of the LeanDog Agile Discussion, so that teams can learn from expeirences alongside the book.

The Introduction To Scrum for DigiPen Teams was the final PowerPoint that I made outlying the important aspects of Agile, the Scrum Process, information gathered from other teams past and present, and notes from classes and professors. This was not meant to serve as a one time resource. This was designed to be presented at a project kickoff to start the ball rolling towards a team being agile. Teams can refer back to this to get the basics of what they should can be doing to improve upon their workflow as a team, producers can use this to work behind the scenes and clear out roadblocks and issues they see arising around a team that is too busy with school and the gaem to notice team work issues. And for teams that feel they want to take things to the next step, I refer them to my stripped down notes from the LeanDog Agile Discussion.
